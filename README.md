## 💼 Featured Projects

### 🚀 [LexPad - Modern Code Editor](https://github.com/NandhakumarE/lexpad)
**React · TypeScript · Performance Optimization**

Feature-rich text editor focused on clean UX and performance.

**Technical highlights:**
- Custom editor architecture for optimal rendering
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Performance-optimized for large files
- **[View Project →](https://github.com/NandhakumarE/lexpad)**

**Why this matters:** Building editors requires deep understanding of React performance patterns, event handling, and state management at scale.

---

### 🏗️ [Design Patterns in TypeScript](https://github.com/NandhakumarE/design-patterns-ts)
**TypeScript · Software Architecture · Best Practices**

Production-tested design patterns with real-world applications.

**Includes:**
- Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns
- When to use each pattern (and when not to)
- TypeScript-specific implementations
- Real-world examples from component libraries

**Why this matters:** Pattern knowledge separates engineers who "write code" from those who "architect systems."

---

### 🧠 [JavaScript Core Implementations](https://github.com/NandhakumarE/just-js-prep)
**JavaScript · Core Concepts · Polyfills**

Deep dive into JavaScript internals through building core functionality from scratch.

**Implementations include:**
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce, flat, flatMap)
- Function utilities (bind, call, apply)
- Promise implementation
- Debounce, throttle, memoization patterns

**Why this matters:** Understanding how JavaScript works under the hood makes you better at debugging production issues and writing performant code.

---

## 🎓 Currently Expanding

### Full-Stack Capabilities
Building production-ready backend systems to understand the full picture:

**Learning:**
- Docker & containerization for consistent deployments
- Jenkins & CI/CD for automated pipelines
- AWS for cloud infrastructure

**Goal:** Combine frontend expertise with backend understanding to own features end-to-end. Better frontend decisions come from knowing backend constraints.

---
